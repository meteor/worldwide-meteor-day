Introduction project: https://github.com/svub/best-meteor-resources - a little web app to collaboratively collect links to great Meteor resources and vote on them. We hacked it together in about 30 to 45 minutes.

* [parcel.gr](http://parcel.gr), a courier service search engine ([George Voulgaris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/voulgaris), if you want to try it out use "meteor@meteor.com:meteor")

Notes:
About 20 to 25 people attended. We started at 7.30pm and intended to stay until 9.30pm. But the participants were so curious and exited, we kept showing, hacking, and discussing until 11pm! Big success! We are looking forward to meet again soon, planning for it already.

### [New York](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-NY/events/212304662/)
Great meetup in NYC.  100+ attendees.  The live coding demo was well received and show & tell had a good mix of simple and polished apps.

We did our 8pm video chat with MDG; a little late getting started and the video chat app's sound setup was kinda funky but still a good experience. A bit more networking and local Q&A after that.

Most people had already tried meteor.  Very few windows users.  Large interest in hosting / scaling.
